# Advent of Code 2022

Every solution is in a file in the `./day` dir. I will be using Lua this
year, until I break down and reach for Python, as usual.

## Usage

To run a day (assuming a solution for that day exists):
```sh
./solve [day_num]
```

To create a solution for a day just copy the template file to a new file named after the day being solved (zero padded):
```sh
cp src/day/template.lua src/day/02.lua
```
