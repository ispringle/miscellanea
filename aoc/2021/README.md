### Day 1

Once I got into being Lispy, this was a breeze! Took me a while to write a
`zip` though, was thinking too hard. Part two seemed much easier, but part two
was just part one... I thought about writing some functions to make my code a
bit cleaner and reuse stuff, but I sort of like the aesthetic of a
deeeeeeeeeeeeeply nested lisp algo, so I just yanked.

### Day 

This was hard, but fun. Hard because Forth lang. Fun because stack-ang :p! I
reached for Retro for two reasons originally, one because it has a lot of
built-ins that were easily accessible (like `file:for-each-line` and
quotations) and second becasue of the `reorder` word -- which I ended up not
using because I eventually got the answer with shuffling. Something else that's
cool about Retro is it has a built-in literate programming tool that lets you
write markdown and it will extract the code from it.
