### Day 1

Once I got into being Lispy, this was a breeze! Took me a while to write a `zip` though, was thinking too hard. Part two seemed much easier, but part two was just part one... I thought about writing some functions to make my code a bit cleaner and reuse stuff, but I sort of like the aesthetic of a deeeeeeeeeeeeeply nested lisp algo, so I just yanked.
